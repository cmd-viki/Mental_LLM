## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get your local copy up and running:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

> 🚀 Runs the app in development mode.  
> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
> The page reloads if you make edits, and you’ll see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

> 🧪 Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
> Check out the section about running tests for more details.

### `npm run build`

> 📦 Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
> This optimizes the build for the best performance, and the build is minified!

### `npm run eject`

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!  
> Ejecting gives you full control over the configuration but is generally not recommended for smaller projects.


If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
